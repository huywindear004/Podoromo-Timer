## Introduction
This simple application is developed by myself just to help my study because:
- I can't 100% focus when study for a long time.
- I don't want to use the online timer which I consider consumes a lot of usage of Ram and Cpu.
- Improve my Java Swing skill
- The amazing design on [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/).
